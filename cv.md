I'm a junior web developer. I believe in readable code and intuitive design.

Makers Academy
--------------
I've always had a strong interest in technology and an appreciation for well-designed software. I managed to pick up HTML and CSS on my own, and was trying to learn Ruby through various online tutorials. Ultimately, I decided to join Makers Academy to not only learn more efficiently but also to learn about best practices in the industry.

I was selected to join the August cohort and attended the course full-time for 12 weeks. The pace of learning was far accelerated beyond what I would have achieved on my own, and this was balanced with an emphasis on independent exploration and experimentation, test-driving our code, pair-programming, and working in teams.

Experience
----------
###Gametize (July 2013–September 2013)
Gametize is a gamification technology and consulting company in Singapore allowing anyone to set up and publish games easily. During my 3-month internship, I supported the business development team by directly meeting and liaising with clients ranging from small businesses to telecommunications companies. As an individual project, I also researched and wrote a white paper on corporate gamification.

Volunteering
------------
###Peer2Peer (February 2014–June 2014)
Peer2Peer aims to strengthen student mental health by training regular students in skills such as active and non-judgemental listening. I redesigned their Wordpress [website](http://ptp.soc.srcf.net) using HTML, CSS, and PHP; and subsequently helped to maintain it. In addition, I also served as peer supporter and learnt how to better support peers going through difficult circumstances.

###Cambridge Hub (April 2013–April 2014)
Cambridge Hub is an umbrella organisation which provides resources and opportunities for students interested in social change. As the Digital Communications Officer, I wrote the weekly HTML email newsletter to >2000 students, produced publicity material, and kept the website content up-to-date.

###Club Heal (June 2012–September 2012)
Club Heal is a day rehabilitation programme for Muslim mental health patients in Singapore. I facilitated the day-to-day running and logistics of the programme, and introduced new activities.
